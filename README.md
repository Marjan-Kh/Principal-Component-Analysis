#### Principal Component Analysis vs Singular Value Decomposition

PCA is an important technique in the fields of statistics and data science. PCA in line with SVD both are some of the most important linear algebra concepts in machine learning. 

I decided to write this program to make PCA method easier to understand. The goal of this program is to see how principal component analysis works and on what type of problems can be applied. For this purpose, the singular values from PCA and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are compared.
